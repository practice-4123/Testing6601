 Hey team,

In Knovos chat parser, we have new requirements for "Process Multiple Files." Simply check the "Process Multiple Files" checkbox, and it will process all the files at once.
For this, you can check the screenshot.

If users want to process multiple files, all processing stages will be the same for each file.
After updating with new changes, if the storage increases to 90%, it will go into "Safe mode," and you can display it in the health check.


After applying new changes, if the storage increases more than 90%, it will go into "Safe mode," and you can see it in the health check.


After applying the new changes, you can now create any new case with special characters and generate any analytics loads. If loads fail for any reason, logs will be generated inside the folder of that special characters case.
